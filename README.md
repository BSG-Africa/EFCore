Entity Framework Core conversion of https://github.com/BSG-Africa/EF6/

All of BulkUpdate, BulkDelete, BulkSelectAndAdd and BulkSelectAndUpdate has been been removed for the time being,
due to the current version (2.1) of EF core generating multiple SQL queries within IQueryables.
As well as issues with queries generated by certain GroupBys and certain Projections.
Will assess at a later stage once the SQL generation of EF has matured a bit more. 

BulkAdd (using SQL BulkCopy) and Truncate operations are still available.
